## How to run it Locally

Here's a few steps to build this app and make it run locally. You'll need a 
running Docker instance and either NodeJS or Python3.

All the following commands are supposed to be run from this directory.

### Step 1 : Build the Database and the server image

_Note : Note that the datas will not persisted since its only expected to be run_
_locally for dev or tests purpose._

```
$ cd datas
$ docker build -t gcpmamie-db .
$ cd ../back
$ docker build -t gcpmamie-server .
```

### Step 2 : Run the backend and the database

```
$ docker-compose up
```

The backend will listen on `localhost:8081Ã¹ 

### Step 3 : Run the client 

If you have NodeJS, you can use thoses commands
```
$ cd front/
$ npm install http-server
$ http-server -p 8080 
```

If you have Python3, you can use thoses commands
```
$ cd front/
$ python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## How to run it on GCP

### Prepare your GCP project

Once you've created your GCP project, add the role `roles/cloudsql.admin` to the
Deployement Manager's service account 
(`<projectnumber>@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com`).

### Create the infrastructure

In the cloud shell console (or if you have a `gcloud` command installed locally),
run : 

```
$ cd gcp/
$ make setup
```

or you can create the infrastructure, resource by resource using :

```
cd gcp/
$ make install-db
```

### Clean up 

If you want to clean up your project, you can either remove everything with :
```
$ cd gcp/
$ make teardown
```

or cleaning up resource by resource : 
```
$ cd gcp/
$ make destroy-db
```
